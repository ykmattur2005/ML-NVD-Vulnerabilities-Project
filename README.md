# ML-NVD-Vulnerabilities-Project
This is a machine learning model using APIs from the National Vulnerability Database, focused on identifying potential vulnerabilities in code that could be exploited by hackers. This machine learning pipeline uses an SVC model, achieving a 93% accuracy rate on vulnerability status prediction after fine-tuning hyperparameters through GridSearchCV.
